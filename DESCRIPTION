Description: Variational EM estimation of mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel for networks,
             incorporating node-level predictors of mixed-membership vectors, as well as 
             dyad-level predictors. For networks observed over time, the model defines a hidden
             Markov process that allows the effects of node-level predictors to evolve in discrete,
             historical periods. In addition, the package offers a variety of utilities for 
             exploring results of estimation, including tools for conducting posterior 
             predictive checks of goodness-of-fit and several plotting functions. The package 
             implements methods described in Olivella, Pratt and Imai (2019) ``Dynamic Stochastic
             Blockmodel Regression for Social Networks: Application to International Conflicts'',
